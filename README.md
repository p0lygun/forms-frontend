# Python Discord Forms Frontend
The frontend component of the [Python Discord Forms](https://github.com/python-discord/forms-backend/) project.
Backend available at: [python-discord/forms-backend](https://github.com/python-discord/forms-backend/).

Our frontend is written in React.js and TypeScript.
It's a fairly simple application to get your head around,
with the whole thing broken down into smallish TypeScript components.

## Setup & Troubleshooting
The project uses [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for dependency and script management,
and [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) for building and development.

A full setup guide is available on [Notion](https://pythondiscord.notion.site/Get-Started-30458bfb32ce4a0e9c489ea66daf0323),
along with a troubleshooting guide.<br/>
